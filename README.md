Are you team #red or #blue team?
=====================

Build for Riot API Challenge May 2016

## What is it?

I created a website which will look at the last few matches played. Based on this information it creates a visualization to show which team the player is on for most of the time. To top this off I've added the ability to check some statistics based on the red or blue team. For example: How many kills did I make in the blue team.

This is how it works:
- Enter your summoner name into the input field (only EUW summoner names accepted at the moment) for example: Timvdv
- Thats it! We're done
- (optional) Send a tweet with your favorite team #teamred or #teamblue

### Demo:

http://timvandevathorst.nl/red-vs-blue/

### Or install it locally

```
Edit the api.php file and enter your own API key

npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
